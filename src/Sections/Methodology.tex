	\section{Metric Builder}

		\subsection{Back End}

			For the Metric Builder the first question we have to address is how to model, store and compute a user metric.
			We distinguish between the following two options:

			\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-1.5mm]
				\item
					Precompute and then store the user metric value for each metric in the database
					\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1.5mm]
						\item
							Pros
							\begin{itemize}
								\item
									Fast to retrieve; no computation needed
							\end{itemize}
						\item
							Cons
							\begin{itemize}
								\item
									Waste of space in the database
								\item
									User metric data remains static;
									update in the underlying data does not cause an update in the user metric unless additional derivation logic for syncing updates is developed 
							\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
				\item
					Store a user metric as a metadata only, in the form of a derivation formula, and compute values on-the-fly (on-demand)
					\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1.5mm]
						\item
							Pros
							\begin{itemize}
								\item
									Efficient use of the database space
								\item
									User metric data is always in sync with underlying data
							\end{itemize}
						\item
							Cons
							\begin{itemize}
								\item
									Might be time-consuming to compute
							\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate}

			Looking at the cons of each option, we evaluated how bad they are.
			Having $n$ users each creating $m$ user metrics each of which has data for $k$ years
			we have $m \cdot n \cdot k \cdot 50$ entries in the database.
			This data would be a snapshot, but it does not appear to be that huge. However, if any data point in the metrics changes, user metrics would remain out of sync. 
			The latter is a more severe problem.

			For the second option, it was difficult to estimate the time it would take to compute a user metric 
			as it depends on the server load and the number of metrics involved in the user metric. 
			For this reason we decided to prototype the second option to be able to benchmark it with $3$ users by focusing on the
			largest possible user metric (namely, one that involves all metrics with all states selected). 
			It took around $1.5$ seconds to load all $3$ user metrics.  Given that we do not expect many metrics, we opted to go with this. 
			This drove our design decision towards the second design decision - computing metrics on-the-fly.
			
			\subsubsection{Note on normalization and missing values}
			
				The basic formula for the user metric is
				
				\[
					V_y = \frac{ \sum_{i \in I} v_{iy} \cdot c_i }{100} 
				\]
				
				where:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
						$V_y$ is the value of the user metric for the year $y$
					\item 
						$I$ is a set of metrics in the user metric
					\item
						$v_{iy}$ is a value of $i_\text{th}$ metric for the year
						$y$
					\item
						$c_i$ is a user defined coefficient of $i_{\text{th}}$ 
						metric ($c \in [0, 100]$) 
				\end{itemize}
				
				However, this does not account for the different magnitudes of different metrics. For example, one metric could be a population and be measured in hundreds of millions, the other one could be taxes, and be measured in percents. If we simply take the average of values in these two metrics, it would not make sense as the value of the higher scale metric (population) will take over the value of the lower scale metric (taxes).

				This problem is solved with \emph{normalization} - adjusting values measured on different scales to a notionally common scale.
				
				We used \emph{z-transform} method to normalize data in the user metric. For each year and metric, normalized piece has the following form.
				
				\[
					\text{value}_\text{normalized} = \frac{\text{value}_\text{denormalized} - \text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}}
				\]
				
				This way we can put together metrics of different scales.
				
				The other decision we had to make was about missing values. Different metrics may have values only for certain years. We decided to take the closest older value for the missing year. If there are no values prior to the missing year, we use the oldest value. 

		\subsection{Front End}
		
			The main goals for the front end of the Metric Builder feature was to design a webpage 
			that was easy to use, easily accessible, intuitive, and consistent 
			with the look and feel of the other pages on the MATTERS site. 
			The Metric Builder feature needed to be a tool that allowed users with any level of 
			technological background to easily build their metric formula from preexisting metrics, 
			assign weights to their chosen metrics, examine the impact of their decisions easily in visual displays, and be able to make changes and/or to correct their metric formula at any time.
			
			The front end for the Metric Builder page was created through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
			To make the page consistent with the rest of the site, code was reused from the Data Explorer page. 
			The Data Explorer page, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:dataexplorer}, within MATTERS allows users to select 
			preexisting metrics (from the left dropdown menus) to then visualize this on the site in multiple different visual display types, 
			including a bar chart, line graph, heat map, or table, by selecting the display type on the right side of the black bar via an icon. The framework for the 
			Data Explorer was the page most similar to how we wanted the Metric Builder to look like. Thus we opted to 
			reuse and modify code from that page to create our new feature. 
			
			\begin{figure}[t]
				\centering
					\fbox{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/dataexplorer.png}}
					\caption{Data Explorer Page}
				\label{fig:dataexplorer}
			\end{figure}
			
			The Data Explorer page allows users to select metrics and states that they would like to view through the use of the left sidebar (See Figure \ref{fig:dataexplorer}). 
			Because the intended users for the Metric Builder feature are meant to be authorized users with 
			experience using the MATTERS Data Explorer, we used the sidebar from the Data Explorer as the 
			basis for how the users would select their metrics on the Metric Builder page as well. Since the Metric Builder does not need a user to select states, 
			that part of the sidebar was removed. We also removed rankings from the metric selection column of the sidebar since rankings are manipulations of 
			various other metrics already found in the database. The Metric Builder can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:mb2}
			
				\begin{figure}[t]
					\centering
					\fbox{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/mb2.png}}
					\caption{Metric Builder In Use}
					\label{fig:mb2}
				\end{figure}
			
			Once a user selects the metrics they wish to use in order to create their own metric formula, they have the ability to assign each of them different weights 
			to decide how much of a factor each of the metric's data will be in the formula. To adjust the weight of a metric, users can use the sliders that appear under 
			each metric that they have selected. The sliders work horizontally from left to right and allow a weight from zero (which would be the same as not including the metric) 
			to one hundred. We chose these values for the weight range to make it easy for users weigh the importance of each metric chosen, and be able to understand how their weights were affecting the metric formula. 
			Users can click on a section of the slider to move to that weight, click and drag to a specific weight or use the arrow keys to move the slider's value up or down. 
			The idea for the sliders came from a New York Times site which allows users to interactively calculate their rent and other values using visual sliders, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:slider} \cite{slider}. The sliders are 
			visually appealing and simple to use and understand.
			
			\begin{figure}[t]
				\centering
				\fbox{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/slider.png}}
				\caption{Example of New York Times' Slider Showing Home Price}
				\label{fig:slider}
			\end{figure}
			
			
			The Metric Builder display offers options for the user to name her new custom metric, save her metric and also go back and edit or delete the metric she had previously created. There is a 
			simple to use button that says "Remove" next to each chosen metric, making it easy for users to change the metrics included in their formula. The input 
			box to name the custom metric and save the changes can be found below all of the chosen metrics and sliders. This was done to help users and encourage them to 
			properly weigh all the selected metrics before leaving and then saving their custom metric formula, as users typically look at a webpage from top to bottom.
		
			Finally, above all of the metrics that were selected there is a box displaying the resulting formula being composed by the selected sliders. As the users update metric selections and their various weights,
			the formula will be continuously updated. It shows the basics of the computation that is to be performed on the back end. This includes showing the users that they are 
			multiplying each data point by the chosen weight before adding each metric's data values together, and that sum is being divided by the total weight as a weighted average approach. 
			As a result of the users weighing each metric, as described previously in Section 3.1.1, the data also goes through a Z-normalization on the back end. This part is not shown in the box so as not to confuse the users, but the basics of the computation being done is still shown to give them an idea. 
			This is shown in a relatively simple fashion to make sure that users can follow along and are aware of exactly what they are changing when they adjust their formulas. 
			Once content, each time a user saves and updates their formula they will be prompted and subsequently directed to the Data Explorer page where they can begin using their custom metrics and displaying the data with the various visualization options. The Data Explorer page also has a link back to the Metric Builder in the sidebar so that users can easily go back and forth between visualizing metrics and creating or editing custom metrics at any time. All of the features of the Metric Builder went through testing and the final design can be seen in Section 4.3.
			

	\section{API}
			
			Implementing an API, there are several design decisions to consider, including:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
					Do we implement a closed API, which are in a controlled environment and serve a very limited audience, or an open API, which are available to use by anyone who registers for a key \cite{openapi}? 
					If closed, how do we implement authentication. 
				\item
					Which methods do we support via this API?
				\item
			        What is the syntax of the query string? 	
				\item
				    What is the output format?
			\end{itemize}
			
			\subsection{Authentication}
				
				Although MATTERS system is a public resource, 
				we decided we would like the ability to track users of our API, how and how often. 
				This requirement made us chose a closed API option. 
				Thinking of authentication, we had a few options, including:
				
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
						Bind to a particular user
					\item
						Simple \emph{API key} (token) authentication
					\item
						Complex \emph{handshake} mechanism					
					\item
						\emph{Handshake} mechanism with random value
				\end{itemize}
				
				Binding the API to a regular user would allow any registered user to access the API. 
				Although this kind of authentication is the easiest one to implement, we instead opted for a separate API for users.
				
				Simple  \emph{API key} authentication is equivalent to when API users are given a unique token 
				(long random string) which they need to provide with each request. 
				Based on this token, the system is able to accept or deny the connection and to track the individual users.
				
				Next, the \emph{handshake} mechanism with a random value involves the following steps:
				
				% source http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs4513/c16/projects/proj2/index.html
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
						Client sends in a username (not password)
					\item
						Server responds by sending back a unique random number
					\item
						Client encrypts using user's password plus number as key
					\item
						Client sends hashed or encrypted value back to server
					\item
						Server encrypts using the user's same password plus number as key
					\item
						Server compares two hashed or encrypted values, if same then grant access
				\end{itemize}
				
				Given that the main purpose of the API being closed is to track user activities
				for statistical purposes, \emph{API key} authentication was deemed sufficiently secure and thus was chosen for implementation.
				The user has to apply for this key separately of creating a regular account.
				The key will uniquely identify the user. If user forgets the key, 
				he or she can recover it through the email.

			\subsection{Methods of the API}
				
				The main method implemented in the API is "\code{api/data?}". 
				This method returns all data points for the requested metrics, states and years.
				
				Since \code{api/data?} needs specific IDs as arguments, there is a need for supporting 
				methods which show information about metrics and states. 
				So we also implemented \code{api/metrics?} and \code{api/states?} as two additional commands. Each method is explained in Section 3.2.4.

			\subsection{Query string and output format}
			
				There are two common options for constructing a query string \cite{qualtrics}, namely:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
						\code{api/method?argument1=value1\&argument2=value2\&...}
					\item
						\code{api/method/value1/value2/...}
				\end{itemize}
				
				To make our API user-friendly, we chose to implement the first option since it clearly 
				shows which value corresponds to which argument. Furthermore, these argument-value pairs may be in any order. 
				Lastly, arguments that have no value can be omitted. If omitted, you will get only the data specifically requested.
				
				The final query strings are given in Listing \ref{apicode}. See
				Appendix \ref{app:apidoc} for an extensive documentation of the
				API.
				
				\begin{lstlisting}[
					frame=lines,
					caption={API Methods Examples}, 
					label=apicode, 
					basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,
					backgroundcolor=\color{codegray}, 
					emph={data,metrics, states},
					emphstyle=\underbar
				]
/* method */
/api/data?metric=<value>&state=<value>&year=<value>&apiKey=<value>
/* example */
/api/data?metric={16,32}&state=MA&year=*&apiKey=key

/* method */
/api/metrics?apiKey=
/* example */
/api/metrics?apiKey=key

/* method */
/api/states?apiKey=
/* example */
/api/states?apiKey=key
				\end{lstlisting}
				
				The output format JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was chosen
				as it both compact and human- and computer-readable. See Listing 
				\ref{ls:apioutput} in Appendix \ref{app:dbsample} for the example 
				of API method output. 
				
			\subsection{Documentation}
				
				In order for the developers to know how to make proper API calls, 
				it was necessary to create the API Documentation page for MATTERS. 
				The documentation provides users with information on the MATTERS API, including how to use it as well as examples of valid API calls and the output 
				that each call would return. It is important to ensure that the API Documentation 
				is easy to read and free of code sample errors, as this tool is 
				what developers unfamiliar with using the API rely on to understand how 
				to properly access and extract data \cite{errors}. 
				
				In order to make the documentation easy to follow, the documentation was divided into sections. 
				The main sections of the API Documentation were: an overview, the methods, 
				the parameters, and examples. The layout of the MATTERS API Documentation was based on the 
				API Documentation of Tradestation, which was simple and easy to follow \cite{apiex}. 
				The Tradestation documentation provided a summary, path, parameters, and examples of both an 
				API call and what it would return. An example of their documentation can be found at: 
				http://tradestation.github.io/webapi-docs/en/users/accounts/ \cite{apiex}. For the MATTERS API, 
				it was necessary to include information on how to retrieve a user's API key. 
				Further we described the proper format to get the data desired for different, years, states, 
				and metrics. The API Documentation sections are explained in the following sections below. 
				The final, complete API Documentation can be found in Appendix \ref{app:apidoc}
				
				
			\subsubsection{Overview of the API}
				
				The API Documentation begins with a summary about what the MATTERS API is and what 
				data points the API tool gives users access to. This section also includes an 
				interactive table of contents which allows users to quickly navigate to a specific 
				section of the documentation to look for information. This allows users to easily 
				find what they are looking for without having to scroll through the entire 
				documentation page. It provides a brief overview of everything that follows.
				
			\subsubsection{API Key Subsection}
				
				Developers without authorization do not have the ability to use the MATTERS API 
				until they have been given an API key. These users are directed to the "Contact Us" 
				page of the MATTERS site in order to send an email request to become an authorized user with their own key. 
				This section also explains that the API key is used in all 
				API calls in order to validate the user's request.
				
			\subsubsection{States Subsection}
				
				In this section, users are instructed on the proper format needed to retrieve a single state, 
				list of states, or all states. If a user does not know any other information 
				regarding the states in the MATTERS system, they are shown where to find the relevant
				information needed via an API request.
				
			\subsubsection{Metrics Subsection}
				
				In this section, users are given the proper format in order to request data for a single metric, 
				list of metrics or all metrics in the MATTERS data warehouse. The documentation explains 
				that in order to access data from metrics, the metric parameter values must be the 
				proper metric's ID number. The user is also given the path to all information 
				regarding the metrics, which will give the user the metric names, ID numbers and details.
				
			\subsubsection{Years Subsection}
				
				Users are given the proper format to request data from specific years. 
				Users may request data for a single year, range of years or all years in the MATTERS data warehouse. 
				
			\subsubsection{Examples of API Calls}
				
				Following the parameters and methods of the MATTERS API, the documentation provides 
				the users with two examples of valid API requests and the data each would return. 
				The example requests include the proper format of the parameter values and the various 
				different types of calls the users can make to request specific data. 
				Under the path name showing an API request there is the option to display the return value of 
				that specific example. Users can view this to see the return data as well 
				as the JSON format it would be given. 
				


	\section{Changes to the database}

		We added two new tables to the database - \textbf{APIUser} and \textbf{User Metric}. 
		See Tables \ref{apiusertable} and \ref{umetrictable}.
		
		For the \textbf{APIUser} relation, \emph{Id} gets autoincremented for each new user.
		\emph{Name} does not have any restrictions and \emph{ApiKey} is a maximum of 160 symbols string.
		The value of \emph{ApiKey} column is a user-unfriendly hash-like string generated by the system.
		
		For the \textbf{User Metric} relation, \emph{Id} and \emph{Name} follow the same rules as in the \textbf{APIUser} relation.
		\emph{Value} column is an arbitrarily long string which represents JSON array of pairs - metric identifier and corresponding coefficient.
		An example of \emph{Value} in \textbf{User Metric} relation: \\
		\code{[{"metricId":"131","coefficient":10},{"metricId":"504","coefficient":30}]}
		\emph{UserID} column is a foreign key referencing the \emph{Id} column in the \textbf{Users} relation and represents the owner of the user metric.
		
		All columns are not nullable meaning that they have to have a valid value.
		This decision was made to keep the database consistent.
