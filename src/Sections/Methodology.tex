\subsection{Metric Builder}

Implementing a Metric Builder, the core question was how to store and compute user metric. We have come to these two options
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Store user metric data in databse
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Pros: fast to retrive; n computation needed
      \item
        Cons: waste of space it database
      \item
        Cons: user metric data remains ststic; update in underlying data does not cause an update in the user metric
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Store user metric as a metadata only and compute values on-the-fly (on-demand)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Pros: efficient use of database space
      \item
        Pros: user metric data is always in sync with base data
      \item
        Cons: might be time costy to compute
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
