\chapter*{Abstract}
	
The goal of this project was to expand the functionality of the Massachusetts 
Technology, Talent, and Economic Reporting System (MATTERS) for the 
Massachusetts High Technology Council (MHTC), a protechnology advocacy and 
lobbyist organization, with two new features - Application Program Interface
(API) and Metric Builder. API defines a communication protocol between MATTERS 
and other computational-based systems. We also wrote an extensive API 
documentation. Metric Builder is a tool that lets users create own metrics with
own rules out of existing MATTERS metrics. Users are now able to define their
own indexes and track individual states' performance.
