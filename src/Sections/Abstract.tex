\chapter*{Abstract}
	
The goal of this project was to expand the functionality of the Massachusetts 
Technology, Talent, and Economic Reporting System (MATTERS) for the 
Massachusetts High Technology Council (MHTC), a protechnology advocacy and 
lobbyist organization, through the addition of two new features an Application Program Interface
(API) and the Metric Builder. This API defines a communication protocol between MATTERS 
and other computational-based systems. We also wrote extensive API 
documentation. The Metric Builder is a tool that lets users create their own metrics with
their own rules out of existing MATTERS metrics. Users are now able to define their
own indexes and track individual states' performance.
