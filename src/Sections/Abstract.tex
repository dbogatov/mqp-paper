\chapter{Abstract}
	
This project expands the functionality of the Massachusetts 
Technology, Talent, and Economic Reporting System (MATTERS) for the 
Massachusetts High Technology Council (MHTC), a protechnology advocacy and 
lobbyist organization, through the addition of two new features, namely, an Application Program Interface
(API) and the Metric Builder. This API defines a communication protocol between MATTERS 
and other computational-based systems. Extensive API 
documentation was developed. The Metric Builder is a tool that allows users to create their own indices with
custom rules out of existing MATTERS metrics. This empowers them to track individual states' performance using their own custom models.
