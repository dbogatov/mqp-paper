\chapter{Conclusion}

	In this project we have built two services for the MATTERS site. The API 
	provides a way for other computer-based systems to work with the MATTERS 
	system. Specifically, it is now possible to query MATTERS data directly, 
	bypassing presentation layer. The other feature is a Metrics Builder. 
	This subsystem allows users to create their own unique metrics based on 
	the existing metrics. Users are able to work with their metrics seamlessly 
	in Data Explorer as if they were just regular ones.  

	\section{Recommendations}
		
		The ways to improve the MATTERS site that might be a good task for the 
		future teams are
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
				Refactor client side and server side code. Since the system 
				has been developed by the number of teams with different design 
				patterns and approaches, there is a significant technical debt. 
				It might be worth spending some time rewriting some parts of the system 
				according to the latest coding and technical standards.
			\item
				Documentation. Right now there is a steep learning curve for the new 
				developers who start working on the project. Good documentation may 
				dramatically decrease a time it takes for developers to start working 
				on the project.
			\item
				Role managemnet. Right now the system supports regular users and API users. 
				Each user metric must have one and only one author. It might be a good idea 
				to merge these two user entities and introduce shared user metrics that are 
				not binded to specific users.
		\end{enumerate}
