\chapter{Background and Related Work}

	The creation of a Metric Builder page and an API for the MATTERS site must 
	leverage as well as seamlessly integrate with the overall MATTERS site, 
	which has been created by several prior project groups at WPI. These 
	students worked to establish the initial features and the design framework 
	for MATTERS to exist. The initial development of MATTERS in Spring of 2014 
	started with a team of eleven students composed of one undergraduate team 
	completing their Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP), and 7 WPI graduate 
	students. This team of IQP students researched and came to the first core 
	decisions regarding the front-end visualization tools for the MATTERS 
	dashboard \cite{prevreport}. This includes the inclusion of decisions 
	regarding colors, and visualization types such as charts and tables, that 
	would be used to the represent the data within the system in a manner that 
	was both intuitive for the users and a quick way to show analytics results. 
	More importantly, the IQP team conducted a survey of the MHTC board members 
	to determine their familiarity and preferences concerning visual interaction 
	components of dashboards. In parallel, the graduate student teams developed 
	the first back-end version for MATTERS. They developed components to extract 
	the desired data from diverse websites, parse and clean this retrieved data, 
	before then uploading it into a data warehouse. This data would then be 
	called upon to be shown in the various visual methods for the users 
	\cite{iqp}.

	Following this initial front-end and back-end design and implementation of 
	the MATTERS dashboard, a team of students working on their Major Qualifying 
	Project (MQP) at WPI improved the administration center and the data 
	integration for the dashboard. This involved the data integration Pipeline 
	Manager. In addition, the Administration Center's development to allow for 
	MHTC and other administrators who had access to be able to easily upload 
	their desired data and metrics, as well as an intuitive way to view this 
	data on the administrative end. This MQP team was able to integrate 20 new 
	data sources for the MATTERS dashboard, make the Administration Center 
	usable for non-technical users, and improve upon the look-and-feel of the 
	MATTERS dashboard as a whole \cite{iqp}.

	\section{System Architecture}
	
		The MATTERS Website consists of two subsystems - the data acquisition 
		and management \emph{admin panel} and the visual-interaction 
		\emph{dashboard}. While the \emph{admin panel} is used by administrators
		to work with data (basic create, read, update, and delete, or CRUD, 
		operations), in this project we focused on the \emph{dashboard} 
		subsystem. This subsystem follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) 
		architecture. You can see its visual structure in Figure 
		\ref{fig:sysarch}.

		\end{figure}
		
		
		\subsection{Model}
			
			The MATTERS' data layer is built with the PostgreSQL database. The 
			main tables are:
			
			\begin{description}[itemsep=-1.5mm, align=right,labelwidth=3cm]
				\item [Statistics]
					holds metrics' data in the form of a year, state, metric and 
					value tuple;
				\item [States]
					holds states' metadata like name, abbreviation and if it is 
					a peer state;
				\item [Metrics]
					holds metrics' metadata like description, trend and 
					category;							
			\end{description}
			
			The access to these tables is provided via stored procedures as a 
			data access layer.
			
		\subsection{Controller}
		
			The business logic of the system resides on a Java-based server. 
			Spring framework is used as a server architecture solution. A front 
			end request that comes to the system goes through controllers which, 
			in turn, invoke services. Services query the data layer and return 
			data stored	in models. These data models get pushed back to the 
			front end.
			
		\subsection{View}
			
			The presentation layer is represented by the HTML based website. The
			client side generates queries to the server via JavaScript AJAX 
			calls, then use the returned data to generate the content. The 
			website has a significant amount of logic on the client side as it 
			needs to build tables, plots and charts. The two main JavaScript 
			libraries used on the client side are jQuery and D3. jQuery makes it 
			easy to manipulate DOM while D3 is used for generating vector based 
			plots and charts.
			
			Visual representation and displays are based on the responsive 
			Twitter Bootstrap 3 framework, which is a collection of CSS classes 
			and small JavaScript snippets. 

	\section{Requirements}

		Before we could embark on creating an API for MATTERS as well as 
		designing the Metric Builder page for the site, we had to conduct 
		research. This included to look into other similar features of different 
		sites and make decisions regarding implementation, design and security 
		features for these aspects of the MATTERS site.

	\subsection{API and Documentation}

		An API is an "Application Programming Interface". APIs are tools that 
		allow other programs to interact with the software program that the API 
		belongs to without having to give someone complete access to your code 
		base. In a sense they expose some of the internal workings of software 
		to the public but in a way that is limited by what the API chooses to 
		provide. APIs aid in providing a way to share a potentially large 
		amount of data in an efficient way. According to the chief data officer 
		of Philadelphia, Mark Headd, APIs "allow a specific audience to use data
		more quickly, easily, and efficiently when they are looking to do 
		something specific with the information." APIs are beneficial for not 
		only keeping certain aspects of code private, but also for saving users 
		time. Even in cases of open source programs where all of the code for a 
		program is visible, the code base can be so large that it is inefficient 
		to search through the whole code base for specific data \cite{govapi}. 

		APIs are beneficial from both a business perspective and for programs 
		that to aim share information and research with many people. An 
		advantage of an API being an automated tool is that it can process a 
		large number of requests without any added cost and work from the 
		developers of the initial site. APIs also present the data requested in 
		a manner that is useful and easily manipulated for the users' purposes, 
		especially if the users could be programmatic access. For APIs whose 
		goals are to share certain data across systems there is a great benefit 
		efficiency wise, as many manual procedures are cut out by the APIs 
		automatic generation. When these tasks are done manually, they waste 
		time and are both laborious and repetitive, as well as being more prone 
		to error; all of these things being costly on the developer end. While 
		it is more time consuming and costly to develop an API initially, the 
		overall benefit once it is developed is apparent and can be reaped 
		long-term \cite{govapi}.

		Additionally, APIs not only encourage innovation and the ability to 
		manipulate and extrapolate data by external collaborators, they provide 
		a means to do so that is more secure for the group creating the API. 
		They reduce the risk of how and what data is obtains and encourage good 
		practice for how to properly manage the data available \cite{readwrite}.

		One important step to gaining the full benefit from an API is making 
		sure that the API is secure. This can be achieved through requiring 
		authentication and authorization of users before they gain access to the
		API's features. It is good practice to ensure that the users are who 
		they say they are and that they are given permission before using data 
		or parts of a developer's program. This also allows for a record of who 
		is accessing the data, in the event that there is an issue so that a 
		specific user can be tracked down \cite{jisc}.

		In addition to creating the API for a site, it is necessary to create 
		good documentation to accompany the API, to make the API as user 
		friendly and simplistic as possible. API Documentation thus must be 
		provided to the developers that details everything that they need to 
		know in a concise manner in order to use the APIâ€™s features with other 
		applications. The API Documentation needs to contain the classes, 
		functions and other important aspects of the API \cite{cio}. The 
		documentation guide allows developers to easily interact with a site's 
		API and their own code, as many developers style their code in their own 
		unique way. 

	\subsection{Metric Builder}

		The main service that is to be developed by our MQP team is the Metric 
		number of the metrics already available in the MATTERS database and 
		combine their data using a custom formula to Builder page. This service 
		will be available for the registered users on the MATTERS website only. 
		A user will be able to select any create their own personal economic 
		"indicator". The user can then use their created formula to display the 
		states' rankings based on this indicator. This will allow users to see 
		and evaluate states based on what they think is most important as a 
		whole or a combination of various factors, and interpret the data in 
		their own way in a simple manner. By enabling users to create their own 
		data set from all the metrics available and then provide their own 
		weights to each of these data values, we are allowing users to see the 
		competitive advantage that each state has based on how important these 
		metrics are for the user's purpose.

		It is important to ensure that different data types can be combined to 
		create one final index value. It is also important to consider the 
		effect that certain data types will have on the final value computed 
		from the user's indicator formula. For example, the MATTERS database 
		contains rankings, percentages, nominal values, and other data types. 
		Certain data types could end up dominating in a user-created indicator 
		when combined with significantly smaller value data types. There are 
		also complexities involved with certain data types that are represented 
		in the reverse of the majority of the data types. For example, both 
		rankings and some other data types use numerical values in which a lower 
		value indicates a better performance by the state, versus for the 
		majority of other metrics the larger the value is the better a state is 
		performing in that area. This corresponds to the data type 
		incompatibility problem, requiring us to learn about data normalization 
		and transformation. 

		Finally, there are many metrics that do not contain a value for every 
		single year that other metrics hold a value, the missing value problem. 
		Situations where one metric being used in the user's Metric Builder 
		equation does not contain values for years that another metric being 
		used in the same equation need to be considered. There needs to be a 
		uniform solution for what to do in these instances in a manner that does 
		not deceive the users of the indicator, as this would affect the 
		calculations and subsequent visualizations across years where these 
		issues exist.

		These factors need to be taken into consideration to provide accurate 
		and understandable visualizations, when users create their own indicator 
		in the Metric Builder. It is for this reason good to consider special 
		handling or removal of certain data types, as well as potential ways to 
		normalize the final numerical values received from the formulas the 
		users have created in the Metric Builder.

		Lastly, we researched various economic indicators in the literature and 
		on other public sites to come up with an idea for how to allow our users 
		to combine sets of data to use for comparisons. One common approach in 
		economic indicators is to use weighted averages \cite{weightedaverage}. 
		For example, one of the most popular economic indicators, CPI, or the 
		Consumer Price Index, uses weighted averages of data from hundreds of 
		different consumer goods and services to measure inflation and 
		deflation. Each of the goods considered by the CPI is weighted based on 
		its importance \cite{cpi}.

		Weighted averages work by taking each number in a given data set, and 
		multiplying the value by its given weight. This will give you a new 
		value reflecting the product of the data and its weight. Lastly, we then 
		add all of these products together from the data set to get the total 
		value. Then, we add up the total of all the weights. Finally divide the 
		total value by the total weight in order to receive the weighted average 
		of your data set. The weights are used to show the importance that each 
		specific item in a data set has in order to calculate an overall value 
		of all the data together \cite{economic}.
